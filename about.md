I am currently enrolled in my 2nd year as a master's student in Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME) at <b>Stanford University</b>. I also have a masters' degree in Applied Mathematics from the <b>Ecole polytechnique</b> (France) where I also studied computer science, quantum and statistical physics. 

I am particularly interested in Natural Language Processing and AI. I have a lot of experience in python and TensorFlow (see for instance my <a href="https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/im2latex">seq2seq implementation</a>).

I worked with the SLAC machine learning group during Winter 17 on applying computer vision techniques for cluster-splitting in ATLAS. I also did a research internship on NER at <a href="https://www.proxem.com/en/">Proxem</a> and a research project with <a href="https://www.riminder.net">Riminder</a> on chatbots. Since September 17, I'm working with the <a href="https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io">Stanford Machine Learning Group</a> on the Error-Correction task. 

During Winter 17, I was a TA for <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/">CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning</a> taught by Christopher Manning and Richard Socher.  I was in charge of lecture notes, accessible <a href="https://github.com/stanfordnlp/cs224n-winter17-notes">here</a>.  
During Spring 17, I was a TA for <a href="">CS234: Reinforcement Learning</a> taught by Emma Brunskill. In particular, I developed the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/assignment2/index.html">assignment on Deep Reinforcement Learning</a>.  
During Fall 17, I was a TA for <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu">CS229: Machine Learning</a> taught by Andrew Ng and Dan Boneh. In particular, I wrote the <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes13.pdf">lecture note on Linear Quadratic Regulation</a>.  
I am currently TAing <a href="http://cs230.stanford.edu">CS230: Deep Learning</a>, taught by Andrew Ng and Kian Katanforoosh, that follows <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai">deeplearning.ai</a> to which I contributed by writing one of the assignment.
